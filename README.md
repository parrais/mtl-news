# MTL News

MTL News is a simple, single-page React app to host news articles, allowing for:

- Viewing a list of all articles, or filtering by topic
- Voting on the viewed article
- Viewing and adding comments on articles
- Sorting of articles by crtieria (date, votes, comment count)

A sample deployment is hosted [here](https://mtl-news.netlify.app/).

A back-end API that complements this front-end app can be found at the [MTL News Backend](https://github.com/parrais/mtl-news-backend) repo.
